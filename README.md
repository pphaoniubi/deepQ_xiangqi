**ReactJS/Python**

This is a Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) with Monte Carlo Search Tree project. It includes game logic, a training algorithm, frontend code, and backend code.

**Motivation:**<br>
- The motivation behind this project is we'd like to learn more about Monte Carlo Search Tree and how to integrate it into a full-stack application.

**Project Steps:**<br>
- Implement the game logic, including piece movements and win conditions.
- Integrate the AI agent to control the pieces.
- Train the AI and save post-training attributes to generate piece moves.
- Use Python FastAPI to send AI-generated moves to the frontend.
- Use ReactJS to display the chessboard and receive AI moves.
  
**Project Goal:**<br>
- The main goal of this project is to learn how to integrate a Monte Carlo Search Tree into a full-stack application, including both frontend and backend. Specifically, we use ReactJS for the frontend and Python FastAPI for the backend.

**Key Takeaways:**<br>
- When coding, we must constantly find ways to optimize computing power to save hardware resources and execution time.
- We have reinforced our SQL knowledge throughout this project.
