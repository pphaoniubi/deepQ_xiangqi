**ReactJS/Python**

<br>This is a chinese chess with reinforcement project. It includes all the chess game logics, the training algorithm, frontend code, and backend code. 

<br>Steps are below: 
1. Finish the game logic, such as piece movements and determining the winner.
2. Integrate the game with AI by handing the controls to AI agent.
3. Following the training, post-training attributes are saved and are used to generate piece moves.
4. Use Python FastAPI framework to forward the piece moves to frontend.
5. Use ReactJS to display the chess board to receive AI piece moves. 
<br>
The main goal of this project is to learn the process of integrating deep Q algorithm to a full application, including frontend and backend. Specifically, reactJS for frontend and python FastAPI framework for backend.


<br>The things We've learnt so far: 
- When it comes to coding, we need to be constantly thinking of a way to use as least computing power as possible. This is critical because it saves hardware resources and time.
- We have reinforced our SQL knowledge.
